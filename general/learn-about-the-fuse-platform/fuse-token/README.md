# Flag Coin (FLAG)

The FLAG coin is the native currency of the Flag blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## FLAG utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Flag blockchain, FLAG is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Coin holders can stake Flag to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100k.&#x20;
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked FLAG. Which means validators with higher amounts of Flag staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any FLAG holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of FLAG they wish. They receive a share of the Flag block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As FLAG is the native currency on Flag, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, FLAG transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of FLAG coins does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Flag platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
