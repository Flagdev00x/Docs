# Flag Overview: vision, strategy and platform components

Flag is a decentralized blockchain-powered platform and technology stack.

The original Flag Blockchain was launched in early 2023. Flag 2.0 was launched in June 2024.

### The Problem

Currently, layer 1 blockchains employing proof of stake (PoS) consensus face several notable challenges. One significant issue is scalability. While PoS mechanisms theoretically offer improvements over PoW in terms of energy efficiency and transaction speed, achieving high scalability remains a complex task. Many PoS blockchains still encounter limitations in scaling to accommodate large numbers of transactions without compromising on security or decentralization.

Moreover, the design and implementation of effective PoS algorithms that balance security, decentralization, and scalability can be intricate and require ongoing refinement. Additionally, concerns persist regarding the distribution of stake and governance within PoS networks, which can impact the integrity and fairness of decision-making processes.

Another critical challenge is the high costs associated with using the network for transactions. As transaction volumes increase, fees on PoS blockchains can rise substantially, affecting the affordability and accessibility of utilizing blockchain applications. Addressing these challenges effectively is crucial for advancing layer 1 PoS blockchain technology to better serve the demands of diverse real-world applications efficiently and sustainably.

### What the crypto industry still lacks

While we are observing a lot of activity in the crypto space (especially in the crypto asset markets, and the DeFi and NFT sectors), genuine mass adoption of crypto and DeFi is still not there.

The currently available products and tools, with their complicated and disparate UX, are mostly geared towards sophisticated crypto users with significant financial means.

### How we go about it

The Flag blockchain and its ecosystem address the challenges facing current layer 1 blockchains, leveraging advanced technological upgrades and innovative approaches. By incorporating the latest Ethereum EIP upgrades within our own fully EVM compatible blockchain, Flag enhances scalability, security, and efficiency. This integration ensures a robust infrastructure capable of supporting high transaction volumes without congestion, leading to faster transaction times and significantly lower fees per transaction compared to traditional PoS blockchains.

One of Flag's key strengths lies in its highly decentralized nature. Utilizing a global consensus mechanism, Flag ensures that decision-making processes are transparent and distributed across a diverse network of validators, promoting fairness and resilience. Additionally, Flag employs a Hybrid DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model within its ecosystem, allowing stakeholders to participate in governance and contribute to strategic decisions effectively.

These innovations position Flag as a frontrunner in the blockchain space, offering a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for a wide range of real-world applications. By addressing scalability issues, reducing transaction costs, and enhancing decentralization through advanced technology and governance models, Flag is committed to unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology for global adoption and utility.

### Platform Components

The Flag platform has three main components:

1\) **The Flag blockchain**. The EVM-compatible public blockchain is the decentralized, permissionless backbone of the Flag platform and ecosystem.

2\) **A set of reference decentralized products and tools**. The goal of these is to pave the way for the initial adoption of the platform.
